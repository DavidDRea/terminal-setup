# Terminal Dotfiles & Bootstrap Setup

This repository contains my personal terminal configuration, including:

- **Zsh** configuration (`.zshrc`)
- **Starship** prompt configuration (`starship.toml`)
- **Custom terminal tools & scripts**
- A **bootstrap installation script** that configures everything automatically on a new system.

With one command, you can clone the repo and apply the entire setup.
